The company intentionally prevents payments made from being applied to the no interest balance, in order to carry that balance through the end of the promotion which would then begin earning interest. There are no materials or billing information listed either in the promotion materials, or the billing statement, that tell consumers that they have to request each time a payment is made, exactly how that payment would need to be applied. Without their knowledge, the agency automatically applies the payments to the non-promotional balances, including when additional payments are made or when no payment is due. This will cause all of the military customers to begin earning interest on a balance that they believed was paid off before the promotion ended.
